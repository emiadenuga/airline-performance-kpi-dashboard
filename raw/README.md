# Raw Data (Airline On-Time)

This project uses BTS On-Time Performance data:
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ontime/

Raw files are not included in this repo. Recommended approach:
- Download a single year month-by-month (12 files)
- Append into one raw annual file
- Create a cleaned dataset in `/data/processed`
